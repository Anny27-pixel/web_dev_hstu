1. Build a function constructor  called Questions to describe a question. A question should include:
a) question itself
b) the answers from which the player can choose the correct one ( choose an adequate data structure here, array, object, etc)
c) correct answer (hint: number will be easier)

2. create a couple of questions using constructor

3. store them all inside an array

4. Select one random questions and log it on the console, together with the possible answer(each question should have a number) (hint: write a method for the question objects for this)

5. use the prompt function to ask the user for correct answer. The user should input the number of the correct answer.

6. check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct or not. (hint: write another method for this)

7. suppose this code would be a plugin for other programmers to use in their code. so make sure that all your code is private and doesn't interfere with the other programmers code. (hint: IIFE)
